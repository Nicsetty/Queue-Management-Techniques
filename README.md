# Queue Management Techniques

This repository explores various queue management techniques used in network traffic control to improve efficiency and reduce congestion.

## Techniques Covered
1. **DropHeadQueue**
   - A queue management technique where packets are dropped from the head of the queue when it overflows.
  

2. **Droptail**
   - A simple queue management approach where incoming packets are dropped when the queue reaches its maximum size.

3. **Global Synchronization**
   - A phenomenon in TCP networks where multiple flows synchronize their transmission rates, often leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization.
    

4. **RED Queue (Random Early Detection)**
   - A proactive queue management technique that randomly drops packets before the queue becomes full to prevent global synchronization and ensure fairness.

## Usage
Clone the repository and explore individual scripts or examples demonstrating these techniques.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicsetty/queue-management.git
